# docs-companion

**Short description**: Gather latex templates for reports, course summaries, and cheatsheets. Overleaf bridge.

## Motivation 

[Overleaf website](https://www.overleaf.com/) (cloud-based LaTeX editor) recently added a feature to classify projects by named and colored categories.
Until now, overleaf projects accumulated without well-defined structure. This new feature gave me the idea to create an 
overleaf-github bridge, in order to **centralize and backup** latex templates.
